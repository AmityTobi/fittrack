# 🏋️‍♂️ FitTrack – Fitness & Wellness WebApp

FitTrack is a clean, modern fitness and wellness landing page built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries. It’s part of my learning journey through [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann, covering everything up to **Section 13**.

- 💡 **Smooth Section Reveal** using the Intersection Observer API
- 🎯 **Tabbed Interface** for feature highlights
- 🚀 **Smooth Scroll Navigation**
- 📌 **Sticky Navigation Bar**
- 🖼️ **Lazy-Loading Images** to boost performance
- 🧠 **Testimonial Slider** with left/right arrows & dots
- 💰 **Interactive Pricing Cards** that highlight on click
- 🧭 **Scroll-to-section** CTA buttons
- ⚙️ **Modal Functionality** (open, close, escape key)

## ⚠️ Limitations

This project is frontend-only and meant for demonstration purposes. Known limitations include:

- ❌ **No real authentication** — all login and signup actions are simulated in memory.
- ❌ **No persistent storage** — user data is not saved after page reload.
- ❌ **No password hashing or backend validation**
- 🔐 **Security not implemented** — not suitable for production use.
- 📧 Email and password validation is minimal and basic.
- 📱 Not fully mobile-optimized — currently best viewed on desktop/tablet.

These will be addressed in future versions or later sections of the course.
